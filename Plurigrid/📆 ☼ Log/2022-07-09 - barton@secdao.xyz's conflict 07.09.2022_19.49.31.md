# `$MATRIX` - simulation token from [[Plurigrid]]
to be available on https://plurigrid.xyz/matrix as the way for a self-bootstrapping energy grid simulation value network, combined with the ability and a dApp / product to run your own simulations that will allow you to:

- run an Akash container or series of containers including w/ GPUs (when functionality comes out) to execute a full-scale, self-contained Plurigrid simulation (includes all the chains involved in the recording of generation / transmission / consumption of power)
- the simulation itself will be indexed and exposed as a GraphQL queryeable indexed dataset asset, that social, systems, energy scientists can use to understand what happened (example of what kind of [[simulation]] types can be run is here: https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/73071.pdf READ THIS or be lost)

## Tokenomics
- simulation token for self-bootstrapping network of value around running simulations of the grid
- airdrop to these organizations [[Xili Mo]]: << please add here -- orgs that we support that do simulation already (onboarding UX priority - easy flow with authorization)

https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/73071.pdf -- run simulations of energy grid as determined by this paper, starting with very simple [[cadcad]] sims and growing as `$MATRIX` allows for more simulations.

Divvying [[$MATRIX]] 1st year, each 5%, to [[NREL]], [[Topos Institute]], political simulation people at Berkeley referred to by [[Daniel Lee]]. Other options include CyberCat, University of Waseda in Japan, and GREQAM https://edirc.repec.org/data/greqafr.html research in France. 25% of initial tokens for "good people". Potentially some social engineering org, perhaps [[Stephen Pimentel]] could offer more insight into that.
